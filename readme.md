Self-learned project, learned from Youtuber Murtaza's Workshop. Note that I used newer opencv-contrib-python verison compared to Murtaza's Workshop, so there're a few grammar changes in the code file. Besides, the sample pictures I used are from video game Love and Deep Space. The website for generating Aruco Markers is https://chev.me/arucogen/. Below is the demo.gif.
